# Airline-Reservation-System-using-C-language
The following program is made to manage the airline database system which will include various different operations with the help of C language. 

This project will help a user book the tickets, retrieve the itinerary, display the record and cancel any itinerary. I have created two different portals for domestic and international travel so that the data be kept separate to avoid a mess.

For every operation being done in the project, different functions are used which are being accessed by the help of switch cases. To reduce the amount of code and increase its efficiency, structures are used to manage the data and all the data is saved in two different .txt files for domestic and international travel via file handling. Other than that the whole database is password protected and only the agent itself can access it in order to keep the database safe.
